### Shhhhh

I wanted to use an old art project I did with a muffler I found on the street. That project was called ‘P.O.S.’ where each color represented the most common letter associated with synesthesia. I always saw the muffler as a snake, though, with the head being the muffler and the long pipe the snake’s body. It even has a tongue!  

The whole purpose of a muffler is to muffle, it’s a silencer. It’s also where the smoke comes out. On one hand I had a vision of making the muffler alive again with smoke billowing out of it like it once did. On the other hand I saw the snake. I needed to marry these two ideas: the actual and the abstract. I decided the snake’s ‘Ssssss’ would be the muffler’s ‘Shhhhh’ via a smoke machine. It was meant to be.  A sound sensor would wake the snake. Smoke would blast the room. There would be silence!
